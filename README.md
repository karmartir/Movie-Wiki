# Movie Wiki

Movie Wiki is a simple React app for discovering movies and managing your personal watched list. Search for movies, view details, and track the films you've seen—all with a clean and interactive UI.

## Features

- **Movie Search:** Search for movies using the OMDb API.
- **Movie Details:** View details including title, year, poster, IMDb rating, and more.
- **Watched List:** Add movies to your watched list, rate them, and keep track of what you've seen.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, responsive interface built with React and Vite.
- **State Management:** Uses React hooks for state and effects.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## How it Works

1. **Search for Movies:** Type a movie name into the search bar. Results are fetched from the OMDb API.
2. **View Details:** Click a movie to see its details and ratings.
3. **Add to Watched:** Mark a movie as watched, optionally rate it, and it will appear in your watched list.
4. **Manage Watched List:** See your watched movies, their ratings, and remove any if needed.

## Purpose

This project is intended as a learning resource and demonstration of React fundamentals, including:

- Component composition and props
- State and effect hooks
- Controlled components
- API fetching and async logic
- List rendering and basic CRUD

## Credits

- Uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for movie data.
